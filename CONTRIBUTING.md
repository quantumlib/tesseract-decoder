# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. We do have
some guidelines to follow, covered in this document, but don't be concerned
about getting everything right the first time! Create a pull request (discussed
below) and we'll nudge you in the right direction.

## Before you begin

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a [Contributor License
Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about) (CLA). You (or your
employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; the CLA simply gives us
permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.
Please visit https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements
on file or to sign a new one. You generally only need to submit a Google CLA
once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different
project), you probably don't need to do it again.

### Review our community guidelines

We have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make the project an open and
welcoming community environment. Please make sure to read and abide by the code
of conduct.

## Contribution process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use the tools provided by GitHub for [pull
requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) for this
purpose. The preferred manner for submitting pull requests is to
[fork](https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository, create a
new [git branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-branches) in this fork
to do your work, and when ready, create a pull request from your branch to the
main project repository.

We follow the [Google coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for
the programming languages used in this project, with only a few deviations. The
[`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) file in this repository defines the settings
we use. Please run `clang-format` on any modified C++ files before submitting a
pull request.
